This program can be used to download pictures that you are allowed to download from the tadpoles website.

This is currently working for a single child. Feel free to reach out if you have multiple children and I can work with you to get it working.

The prerequisite for this to work properly is to go into chrome settings and make sure you have it set to automatically download items
It might be good to set a specific folder instead of your downloads to keep the pictures separate from everything else.

You will also have to get the correct password for this work.

Go here: https://www.tadpoles.com/home_or_work to try it out first.

This is what the program does:

1. It grabs your login information and logs you into tadpoles
2. It goes through each month and each memory
3. For a given memory it looks to see if it is downloadable
4. if it is, it will click the download button then move on
5. if not, you see the cute memory and it keeps going anyways
